I created a portfolio with the four most recent projects. If there isnt four currently then I leave it open with a coming soon title. I made the application dynamic using media screen and set the size to 1400px as the max-widtd. I used classes and Id's to refer to elements from the HTML and used href to go to any links needed. I also used href to let HTML know it is getting its style sheet from the css. I used semantic element tag to clearly mark what is what. I did not use a single div tag as it was not needed. I hope to make my portfolio even better and possibly add script.js to make it dynamic and more interesting.
